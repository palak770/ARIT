# ARIT
# AI Research-Agent Information Tracker (ARIT)

> **Purpose:** A secure, auditable platform for government and authorized agencies to perform automated intelligence research (OSINT + authorized feeds), correlate signals, and produce privacy-preserving, actionable alerts for scams, terror planning, public-safety threats, and women/child safety incidents.  
> **Important:** ARIT is designed for *defensive, lawful, and ethical* use only. It does **not** facilitate unauthorized data access or surveillance without legal basis.

---

## 🚩 Overview

ARIT is a multi-agent research and reasoning system that:
- Runs inside a secure, permissioned environment (sandbox/VPC).
- Performs autonomous, policy-constrained research across **publicly available** sources and **authorized** feeds.
- Extracts entities and relationships via NLP & multimodal pipelines.
- Builds and maintains a knowledge graph linking entities (people, accounts, wallets, events).
- Correlates signals and scores incidents (fraud, terror indicators, grooming, safety threats).
- Produces human-readable, provenance-rich intelligence reports and secure alerts to authorized stakeholders.

---

## Goals & Scope

**Primary goals**
- Early detection and triage of national-scale scams, coordinated disinformation, terror planning indicators, and safety threats to women/children.
- Privacy-preserving correlation & evidence management with full audit trails.
- Human-in-the-loop workflows for validation and operational response.

**Out of scope**
- Any attempt to perform illegal access, doxxing, or mass scraping of private databases without legal authority. ARIT assumes MOUs/authorized integrations for private sources.

## Core Components

### 1. Ingestion Layer
- Permissioned connectors: enterprise social APIs, threat intel, telecom metadata (authorized), payment/fraud alerts (MOU), CCTV metadata (authorized), OSINT crawlers.
- Rate limiting, normalization, and provenance stamping.

### 2. Preprocessing & Privacy Layer
- Language detection, deobfuscation, OCR/ASR preprocessing.
- Pseudonymization/tokenization of PII by default.
- PII vault with strict access & justification gating.
- Data retention & automatic purge policies.

### 3. Agent Research Orchestrator
- Multi-agent system: specialized agents (SocialAgent, FinancialAgent, DarknetAgent, GeoAgent, MultimediaAgent).
- Agents fetch, preprocess, extract entities, and submit signals with provenance.
- Sandboxed execution, strict egress controls, and operator-level quotas.

### 4. NLP & ML Modules
- NER, relation extraction, intent classification, deception scoring, multilingual support.
- Multimodal: OCR on images, ASR for audio, CV for images/videos.
- Explainability outputs (key phrases, matched rules, top evidences).

### 5. Knowledge Graph
- Stores entities (Person, Phone, Wallet, URL, IP, Device, Event) and relationships.
- Each node/edge includes confidence score and source provenance.
- Supports path queries, pattern matching, and graph analytics.

### 6. Correlation & Scoring Engine
- Rule-based + ML ensemble to produce incident scores and suggested playbooks.
- Supports configurable thresholds and priority levels.

### 7. Human-in-the-loop & Playbooks
- Investigator UI for reviewing flagged incidents, adding evidence, assigning cases.
- Playbooks for live responses (freeze transaction, notify bank, local police dispatch).

### 8. Alerting & Delivery
- Secure channels (mTLS / encrypted push / signed messages) to authorized agencies.
- Exportable, redacted intelligence packages for legal action.

### 9. Audit & Evidence Integrity
- Immutable audit logs; optional hash anchoring to ledger for tamper evidence.
- Full chain-of-custody metadata for each signal and operator action.

## Security & Compliance

- **Access control:** RBAC, MFA, hardware-backed admin keys.
- **Encryption:** TLS 1.3 in transit; AES-256 at rest; field-level encryption for PII.
- **Data minimization:** Only ingest and retain data necessary for a case; pseudonymize by default.
- **PII governance:** PII quarantine vault (access logs, justifications, automated purge).
- **Legal controls:** MOU & SOP enforcement for private feeds; auditability for oversight bodies.
- **Ethics & Oversight:** Independent review board, regular model audits, red-teaming, and public transparency reports (aggregate).

---

## Data Sources & Integrations (authorized only)

- Public OSINT: news, blogs, public social posts.
- Enterprise APIs: social media enterprise endpoints (for authorized government accounts).
- Threat intelligence providers: domain/IP reputation, malware feeds.
- Telecom metadata (CDR, anonymized) & SIEM feeds — via legal agreements.
- Financial fraud alerts / bank feeds — via MOU.
- Blockchain explorers for public-chain analytics (Etherscan, public APIs).

> **Note:** All private/regulated integrations require documented legal authorization.

## Knowledge Graph Schema (sample)

**Entities:** Person, Account, Phone, Email, Wallet, URL, IP, Device, Location, Event, Organization  
**Edges:** owns, uses, transacted_with, posted_by, located_at, associated_with, reported_by, observed_in

Each node/edge includes:
- `confidence_score`
- `sources[]`
- `first_seen`, `last_seen`
- `provenance` (ingestion record id)
- `redaction_flag` (if PII)

---

## Agent Examples

- **SocialAgent:** monitors public social posts, extracts entities, detects coordinated repost patterns.
- **FinancialAgent:** analyzes payment/transaction alerts (authorized), identifies funneling or micro-transfer patterns.
- **DarknetAgent:** ingests indexed public darknet forum data or licensed intel feeds.
- **GeoAgent:** correlates geotagged posts, CCTV metadata (authorized), maps hotspots.
- **MultimediaAgent:** performs OCR, ASR, and CV on authorized media content.

---

## APIs (internal / operator)

> These endpoints are for authorized internal use only. Access is strictly controlled by API tokens and mTLS.

- `POST /v1/signals` — submit a raw ingestion record (authorized sources)
- `GET /v1/incidents` — list triaged incidents (RBAC enforced)
- `GET /v1/incidents/{id}` — get incident with provenance & evidence
- `POST /v1/incidents/{id}/ack` — acknowledge & attach action
- `POST /v1/kyc-query` — (authorized, audited) request for PII-unredacted data with justification (requires approval)

---

## Operational Considerations

- **Deployment:** Kubernetes in private VPCs, HSM for keys, private container registries.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack; SIEM integration.
- **CI/CD:** Pipeline with security scanning, model validation gates, canary deployments.
- **DR / Backup:** Cold storage for long-term evidence, geo-redundant backups.
- **VAPT & SOC:** Periodic VAPT, 24/7 SOC for incident response.

---

## Evaluation & Metrics

- **Detection performance:** Precision, recall, F1 per threat class.
- **Operational SLAs:** ingestion → alert latency for high-priority signals.
- **False positive rate:** monitored and reduced via human-in-loop feedback.
- **Time-to-validate:** mean time for analyst validation.
- **Model drift monitoring:** continuous validation and retraining schedule.
